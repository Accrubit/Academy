# Business Use Cases

{% hint style="success" %}
### **Chapter Summary**

* A blockchain is a chronologically sorted, distributed, digital ledger which contains an irreversible archive of transaction records that are stored and chained together in batches called blocks 
* Blockchain was invented with Bitcoin, but they are not the same thing
* Blockchain ledger systems enable secure peer-to-peer transactions, settlement in real time, programmable contracts, and increased communication, transparency, and availability for participants.
* Traditional ledger systems involve multiple 3rd parties, delayed settlements, and redundant, competing systems in order to settle and fulfill transactions between participants.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
### **Time to Reflect:**

* What are some ways programmable contracts can improve business?
* Why shouldn't we just use the systems we already have?
* If blockchains are so much better, why aren't they being used everywhere?
* Are blockchains just for payments or can they be used for other cases?
{% endhint %}

**In the** [**next chapter** ](https://learn.accrubit.com/blockchain-for-business/business-use-cases)**we will go over these questions and more as we review the most prominent use cases \(and non-use cases\) for blockchain technology.**
