# Intro to Blockchain

This will be the most abstract module in the guide, so don't feel concerned if the dots aren't being connected at the end.

### **Where did blockchain come from?**

Blockchain was first invented with the development of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which is a peer to peer digital currency and settlement network that enables individuals to store, retrieve, and transact anywhere in the world across any border without needing a 3rd party to facilitate the service. [\[1\]](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)  
  
It's important to note, that Bitcoin and blockchain are not synonymous with each other anymore. Blockchain is the underlying software that enables Bitcoin to exist, but like any other software product there are many different variations on the market. [\[2\]](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2017/05/the-difference-between-bitcoin-and-blockchain-for-business/)  
  
Due to this, there are hundreds of definitions for blockchain circulating around the internet, most of which are inaccurate. As a blockchain developer, the below definition is what you want to actually remember.

> ### A blockchain is a chronologically sorted, distributed, digital ledger which contains an irreversible archive of transaction records that are stored and chained together in batches called blocks.

Now to some this definition is already too technical, but that doesn't change the fact you need to memorize it. 

### **So why is this ledger technology useful?**  

Financial institutions, among others, have been using digital ledgers for decades now, but the difference and innovation behind a blockchain ledger is that the data is shared between participants in real time and utilizes programmable smart contracts to ensure settlements take place within the agreed upon rules of the network. [\[4\]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/generalledger.asp)[\[5\]](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SE-09.pdf)

> ### **Consider ATM machines:** Each machine is owned by a single institution, but accepts cards from a huge network. This sharing requires a [complicated management apparatus](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/history-visa-probably-different-think/), [mostly provided by VISA](http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/market-share-statistics.php). That central entity owns the database and transaction processing layer, which makes everything else possible.  If the process of using an ATM had been invented today, with blockchain as a state-of-the-art database technology as an option, we would most likely not need an administrative entity like VISA to manage the process. Instead, the technology itself would do the heavy lifting of uniting the interests and business processes of the member banks.  ​One can easily imagine a single global blockchain network for managing the interoperability of bank cards. Rather than creating hub-and-spoke methods for organizing our shared resources for mutual advantage, this new technology would provide solutions without any central oversight.

### **How do blockchain ledgers actually work?**

On a blockchain ledger, each block of records is cryptographically chained to the previous block of records \(hence the name\) making it impossible to go back and edit even a single binary of data without creating a separate invalid ledger.  
  
Blockchains allow for an open, or controlled, set of users to participate in the management of the ledger, with each record and block being linked to a specific participant. Each and every participant possesses a true and verifiable record of each and every transaction ever recorded on the ledger.

Since blockchains are peer-to-peer, they can only be updated by following a programmable consensus protocol that all participants in the system have to adhere to in order to write data to the blockchain. This consensus method varies between blockchains, and is engineered based on the unique requirements of the participants using the ledger.  
​  
We can compare this to traditional ledgers which are stored in standard databases on centralized servers within the specific organization the data belongs to. These databases have administrators who can technically read, write, modify, erase, and sort the data in any way they wish. In order for these ledgers to communicate between participants in the network, they must use a trusted 3rd party to mediate and oversee the exchange, requiring a complex management and administrative system.

> ### What blockchain does for business is allow separate entities to utilize a master ledger for the transfer and settlement of assets without the need for a 3rd party intermediary or complex management system.

### **Summary**

* A blockchain is a chronologically sorted, distributed, digital ledger which contains an irreversible archive of transaction records that are stored and chained together in batches called blocks.
* Blockchain was invented with Bitcoin, but they are not the same thing
* Blockchain ledger systems enable secure peer-to-peer value exchanges, settlement in real time, programmable contracts, and increased communication, transparency, and availability for participants.
* Traditional ledger systems involve multiple 3rd parties, delayed settlements, and redundant, conflicting systems in order to settle and fulfill changes between participants.

### What's next?

1. What's the big picture here?
2. How is this special programmable ledger going to change the world?
3. Why shouldn't we just use what we have?
4. If blockchains are so much better, why aren't they being used everywhere?
5. Are blockchains just for payments or can they be used for other cases?

####  **In the next module we will go over these questions and more as we review the most prominent use cases \(and non-use cases\) for blockchain technology.**
